The is-parallel condition on a group is safe to set for any output
block, including elements needed for the detection of parallels.
It is not cast as a normal conditional exactly because of the need
to make it robust in this way -- conditions must be evaluated before
rendering content, while groups create a wrapper in the output
queue, determination of the fate of which can be deferred.
