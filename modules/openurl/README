OpenURL Module
  
--- Description ---
  This module provides a few convenience functions for generating OpenURL links.

--- Configuration ---
  The settings page can be found at /admin/settings/openurl. 
Here you can configure where the link resolves to, what icon to use for the link etc.


Should I specify multiple links? With Human/Machine readable names? that can then be used in theme's etc.
Or a single default link?

Can we set defaults for the parameters?
Add an upload option for images to be used as icons?
